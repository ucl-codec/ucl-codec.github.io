<h1 align="center">PASSIAN</h1>

Welcome to the dashboard for the PASSIAN Project - aka Piloting A Secure, Scalable, AI-enhanced Infrastructure for Dementia Research On Real-world Data 

Our overarching goal is help combat dementia by building research capability for AI in 
healthcare using real-world data. 

<img align="center" src='/images/ai_healthcare_banner.png'/> 

## Overview of the project

People are living longer than ever, and so age-related dementias are a key challenge to 
21st-century medicine and healthcare. Dementia-causing diseases are complex and poorly 
understood. Artificial intelligence (AI) models are being developed on artificial research 
datasets, which are generated in highly controlled, unrealistic scenarios. To truly unlock the 
potential of AI in dementia research requires access to real-world, diverse biomedical data 
from the front-line: NHS Memory Clinics. Our goal is to overcome this critical roadblock to AI 
research by leveraging our clinical connections and data (we run two NHS Memory Clinics). 
We will use high performance computational resources in combination with our biomedical 
research expertise (we lead international dementia and AI initiatives). This will allow us to 
deliver a proof-of-concept, secure, scalable, AI-enhanced infrastructure for dementia 
research on clinical data. We will also test whether AI confers benefits for enhancing real-
world (noisy, low-quality) medical images. 
 
By opening a portal between AI researchers and real-world data from the NHS we will 
enable and facilitate impactful future AI research in dementia. Piloting a solution to 
accessing real-world data in a secure research environment is the only way for AI to have a 
tangible and lasting impact on dementias in the real world.

                <h2>QMIN-MC</h2> 
                <p>The aim of the QMIN-MC study is to build a dataset that can be used to validate new artificial intelligence (AI) method in the real world memory clinic setting across the UK. These AI tool uses brain scans and can help in various ways, for example to speed up the diagnosis of memory and thinking disorders, and to help us predict what might happen in the future to people with Alzheimer’s disease and similar diseases.
                
                The vision behind this project is that of providing artificial intelligence guided tools making the best use of all the available information from brain scans to support memory clinics in decisions about diagnosis and care.</p>

# Team 

Our team features world-leading experience in developing and applying AI and machine 
learning in dementias. We also work with the Deep Dementia Phenotyping (DEMON) Network 
(demondementia.com; led by Co-I Llewellyn), which is an international network including over 1,200 
academics and clinicians dedicated to collaborative innovation applying data science and AI 
to dementia research.
