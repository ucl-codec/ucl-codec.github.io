## PASSIAN Final meeting 

We had our final meeting for the PASSIAN project at UCL on Monday 13 March 2023. 

Despite some construction work happening right outside the window, we managed to have a very engaging and interesting conversation with our team (UCL, Cambridge, Exeter) and a few special guests from KCL and QMUL.

Everyone was particularly impressed with the work led by our front-line team of Bojidar, Marcella, and Tom.
