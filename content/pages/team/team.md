Our team features world-leading experience in developing and applying AI and machine 
learning in dementias. In particular, our Deep Dementia Phenotyping (DEMON) Network 
(demondementia.com; led by Co-I Llewellyn) is an international network including over 1,200 
academics and clinicians dedicated to collaborative innovation applying data science and AI 
to dementia research. We will leverage this extensive network and expertise to deliver 
unique value for this call, rapidly piloting infrastructure to build AI research capacity.
